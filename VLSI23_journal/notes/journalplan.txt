Main motivations:
- coarse voltage resolution because sensor capacitance is small (thin because it is small area)
- noisy spikes good enough

Tasks A (simulate + measure using ideal input)
- bode plot of vpos_afe; bode plot post-RC of LCADC (direct input w/o sensors) -> measured BW is open-loop bandwidth; actual BW is higher (lower closed-loop gain)
why low fHPF? To acquire static force info, despite using only piezoelectric sensors

	why directly inject at Vminus? Parasitics at pad and pcb connection pulls HighZ node low resulting to moved Vcm and low gain -> Millman

	FIGS: bode plot of vpos_afe (ideal vs measured at discrete points (5 per decade as Mohit's)) @ 3 ITAIL values
	FIGS: bode plot post-RC (simulated) @ 3 ITAIL values

- LCS/N-LCS circuit-level

	FIGS: 
		- //MC of Signal conditioning gain
		- //MC of LCS comparator offset
		- //MC of N-LCS comparator offset
		- //MC of N-LCS step + tau

	- difficult to measure first stage in feedback because it always behaves as open loop when you directly inject voltage input to VPOS_IN
	- any mismatch on the DC common mode applied to vminus to the actual vcm at vplus will be amplified
	- there is no forward DC path since the 2nd stage blocks DC
	- static and dynamic error (low area + low power)
	- compare measured VPOS_AFE,pp to simulated post-filtering

	- why 1nA bias?
		-low GBW is fine. Low closed-loop BW
		-low iin,pp due to high Zin at passband

- AER interface
	- schematic
	- timing waveform
	- I/O to 5V	

- SER + ITC by varying bit resolution (fixed IBIAS_TAIL) -> sine input. NOTE: Ali's paper has concluded that SER is not a good indicator of Linear SVM or SNN accuracy, but information-theoretic criteria (ITC)
	-vmode: N (VREFH, VREFL)
	-imode: VBIAS_IL (nominal at 0.8V), IBIAS_SLEW (fixed at >75nA ~192k evps), IBIAS_SPK (1uA,5uA,10uA), IBIAS_SPK_FAST (FASTTAU_EN=1 (reg)) (1uA,5uA,10uA), IBIAS_BLEED (fixed), IBIAS_TH (fixed);
	- information-theoretic tuning/ Ali Safa
	- effect on classification

	FIGS: 
		- VMODE:  SER vs N
		- IMODE:  SER vs offset (fast), offset (slow), tau1 & tau2 (tau1 & tau2 are tuned together)
		- classification vs ITC + SER for both VMODE, IMODE


- linearity + noise of vpos_afe  NOTE: while noise density improves, bandwidth also increases with ITAIL -> open-loop vs closed-loop -> BW vs noise tradeoff 
	- BW tunability only possible if you move Amplifier BW lower than upper corner freq (1/2pi*Rin*Csensor)=2.3GHz >> GBW (single pole system)
	- measure VPOS_AFE noise on sensorized chip
	vary: IBIAS_TAIL, VRESGATE_AVDD (reg)
	- effect on classification

	FIGS:
		- VMODE:  input-referred noise vs ITAIL (measured vs simulated) + noise spectrum?
		- //VMODE:  SER vs ITAIL (due to noise) 
		- //IMODE:  SER vs ITAIL (due to noise)
		- //IMODE:  SER at 2 values of VRESGATE_AVDD
		- VMODE:  measured vs simulated spectrum of VPOS_AFE (THD vs input levels)
		- IMODE:  simulated spectrum (with tones) at 2 values of VRESGATE_AVDD
		- classification + ITC (+SER?) vs noise (@ max accuracy params)
		- classification + ITC (+SER?) at 2 values of VRESGATE_AVDD (@ max accuracy params)


	- THD of 1% for biomedical signals [Genco,JSSC23]
- taxel mismatch (8/16 bonded channels)

	FIGS: 
		- VMODE: 

- max out resolution (needs better PCB)
- max out spike rate (needs FPGA + pin adapter)
- CRF (fixed imode params?)
	vary: HEM_RATIO (IN:OUT = 0 - 1:1; 1 - 2:1; 2 - 3:1; ... 15 - 16:1)
	measure: HEM_OUT?


	FIGS:
		- IMODE:  spikes at different HEM_RATIO
		- IMODE:  simulated current ratios vs HEM_RATIO
		- IMODE:  HEM_OUT at different HEM_RATIO 

- Power consumption
- TSENSOR
	FIGS: TSENSE vs temperature (multiple sensors - establish 3sigma?)
	need extra board to wire DVDD, AVDD, ITAIL(?), TSENSE, AGND


- noise on VPOS_CM 
	-referred to Vout = VPOS_CM (1 + Zfb/Zin) - VPOS_CM (Zfb/Zin) = VPOS_CM

-------------------------------------------------------

Tasks B (compare with ideal input and real sensors)


------------------------------------------------------
Tasks C (possible with real sensors only)
- poling setup + waveforms
- FIB cross-section
- taxel mismatch

	FIGS:
		- VMODE: spike rate per taxel at uniform pressure step (different forces)
		- superimpose with normalized taxel firing rate for just 8/16 channels (indicate added mismatch due to sensors)


- shape/texture classification

	FIGS:
		- classify acdg. to ideal spike params (from Ali Safa information-theoretic)

- CRF for classification (effect of spatial configs)


	FIGS:
		- classify acdg. to ideal spike params (from Ali Safa information-theoretic)

- Power consumption	

Optional:
- BMW action-condition
- SNN hardware


--------------------
Add motivation at the beginning?
- biological sensing
- spikes vs frames - makes sense power-wise at low SNR
- noise tolerance


To-test
- IMODE -> FPGA control
- IMODE -> spike recording + CRF
- VPOS_AFE tests -> gain response (with and without sensor CL), linearity (THD), noise
- TSENSE
- Actual sensor response -> shapes (show frames)
- Taxel mismatch: sensor vs without

- motivation: frames vs spikes (adaptive/power-efficient and fast sampling rate). Normalized Classification vs noise (white vs colored), mismatch, etc. Robust to systematic errors (static,dynamic errors, etc) -> all for area and power-efficiency
- classifier results (VLSI)
- re-do dataset?
- gloves

For tomorrow:
- see result of bodeplot 50nA
- check model spikes
- run classifier on model spikes

For rest of week:
-additional figures for sensor?

- setup teensy
- imode
- sensor testing
